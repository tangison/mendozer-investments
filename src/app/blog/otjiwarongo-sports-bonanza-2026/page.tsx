              <h2>One weekend. Three sports. One community.</h2>
              <p>
                Mendozer Investments is bringing the Otjiwarongo Sports Bonanza to Mokati Stadium from Friday 21 August to Sunday 23 August 2026. Three days of competitive soccer, netball, and volleyball, capped with a live music show on Saturday night headlined by King Tee Dee. The full prize pool sits at N$45,000, spread across three sports and multiple placement tiers, so more teams walk away with something.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bonanza is built around a simple theme: Sport, Music, Unity, Community. Mendozer Investments is putting real money behind local sport because the Otjiwarongo community has the talent and the energy to match. Whether you are a player, a coach, a fan, or a music lover, there is a lane for you across the weekend.
